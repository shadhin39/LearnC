     Fibonacci Series in C

Fibonacci Series in C: In case of fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc. The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.
There are two ways to write the fibonacci series program:
Fibonacci Series without recursion
Fibonacci Series using recursion
Fibonacci Series in C without recursion
Let's see the fibonacci series program in c without recursion.

#include<stdio.h>    
int main()    
{    
 int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,number;    
 printf("Enter the number of elements:");    
 scanf("%d",&number);    
 printf("\n%d %d",n1,n2);//printing 0 and 1    
 for(i=2;i<number;++i)//loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed    
 {    
  n3=n1+n2;    
  printf(" %d",n3);    
  n1=n2;    
  n2=n3;    
 }  
  return 0;  
 }


Output:
Enter the number of elements:15
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 
Fibonacci Series using recursion in C
Let's see the fibonacci series program in c using recursion.


 #include<stdio.h>    
void printFibonacci(int n){    
    static int n1=0,n2=1,n3;    
    if(n>0){    
         n3 = n1 + n2;    
         n1 = n2;    
         n2 = n3;    
         printf("%d ",n3);    
         printFibonacci(n-1);    
    }    
}    
int main(){    
    int n;    
    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");    
    scanf("%d",&n);    
    printf("Fibonacci Series: ");    
    printf("%d %d ",0,1);    
    printFibonacci(n-2);//n-2 because 2 numbers are already printed    
  return 0;  
 }


Output:
Enter the number of elements:15
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
