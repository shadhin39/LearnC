    C goto statement
****************************
The goto statement is known as jump statement in C. As the name suggests, goto is used to transfer the program control to a predefined label. The goto statment can be used to repeat some part of the code for a particular condition. It can also be used to break the multiple loops which can't be done by using a single break statement. However, using goto is avoided these days since it makes the program less readable and complecated.
Syntax:

label:   
//some part of the code;   
goto label;  
goto example
Let's see a simple example to use goto statement in C language.

#include <stdio.h>  
int main()   
{  
  int num,i=1;   
  printf("Enter the number whose table you want to print?");   
  scanf("%d",&num);  
  table:   
  printf("%d x %d = %d\n",num,i,num*i);  
  i++;  
  if(i<=10)  
  goto table;    
}  



Output:
Enter the number whose table you want to print?10
10 x 1 = 10
10 x 2 = 20
10 x 3 = 30
10 x 4 = 40
10 x 5 = 50
10 x 6 = 60
10 x 7 = 70
10 x 8 = 80
10 x 9 = 90
10 x 10 = 100

When should we use goto?
The only condition in which using goto is preferable is when we need to break the multiple loops using a single statement at the same time. Consider the following example.

#include <stdio.h>  
int main()   
{  
  int i, j, k;    
  for(i=0;i<10;i++)  
  {  
    for(j=0;j<5;j++)  
    {  
      for(k=0;k<3;k++)  
      {  
        printf("%d %d %d\n",i,j,k);  
        if(j == 3)  
        {  
          goto out;   
        }  
      }  
    }  
  }  
  out:   
  printf("came out of the loop");   
}  
0 0 0
0 0 1
0 0 2
0 1 0
0 1 1
0 1 2
0 2 0
0 2 1
0 2 2
0 3 0
came out of the loop
