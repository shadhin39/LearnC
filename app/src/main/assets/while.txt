   while loop in C
**********************

While loop is also known as a pre-tested loop. In general, a while loop allows a part of the code to be executed multiple times depending upon a given boolean condition. It can be viewed as a repeating if statement. The while loop is mostly used in the case where the number of iterations is not known in advance. 
Syntax of while loop in C language
The syntax of while loop in c language is given below:

while(condition){  
//code to be executed  
}  

 

Example of the while loop in C language

#include<stdio.h>  
int main(){    
int i=1;      
while(i<=10){      
printf("%d \n",i);      
i++;      
}  
return 0;  
}    


Output
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10


#include<stdio.h>  
int main(){    
int i=1,number=0,b=9;    
printf("Enter a number: ");    
scanf("%d",&number);    
while(i<=10){    
printf("%d \n",(number*i));    
i++;    
}    
return 0;  
}  


 
Output
Enter a number: 50
50
100
150
200
250
300
350
400
450
500
Enter a number: 100
100
200
300
400
500
600
700
800
900
1000

Properties of while loop
A conditional expression is used to check the condition. The statements defined inside the while loop will repeatedly execute until the given condition fails.
The condition will be true if it returns 0. The condition will be false if it returns any non-zero number.
In while loop, the condition expression is compulsory.
Running a while loop without a body is possible.
We can have more than one conditional expression in while loop.
If the loop body contains only one statement, then the braces are optional.
Example 1

#include<stdio.h>  
void main ()  
{  
    int j = 1;  
    while(j+=2,j<=10)  
    {  
        printf("%d ",j);   
    }  
    printf("%d",j);  
}  


Output
3 5 7 9 11
Example 2

#include<stdio.h>  
void main ()  
{  
    while()  
    {  
        printf("hello Javatpoint");   
    }  
}  



Output
compile time error: while loop can't be empty	
Example 3


#include<stdio.h>  
void main ()  
{  
    int x = 10, y = 2;  
    while(x+y-1)  
    {  
        printf("%d %d",x--,y--);  
    }  
}  



Output
infinite loop
