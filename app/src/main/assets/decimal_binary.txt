  C Program to convert Decimal to Binary


Decimal to binary in C: We can convert any decimal number (base-10 (0 to 9)) into binary number(base-2 (0 or 1)) by c program.
Decimal Number
Decimal number is a base 10 number because it ranges from 0 to 9, there are total 10 digits between 0 to 9. Any combination of digits is decimal number such as 23, 445, 132, 0, 2 etc.
Binary Number
Binary number is a base 2 number because it is either 0 or 1. Any combination of 0 and 1 is binary number such as 1001, 101, 11111, 101010 etc.


Decimal to Binary Conversion Algorithm
Step 1: Divide the number by 2 through % (modulus operator) and store the remainder in array
Step 2: Divide the number by 2 through / (division operator)
Step 3: Repeat the step 2 until number is greater than 0
Let's see the c example to convert decimal to binary.

#include<stdio.h>    
#include<stdlib.h>  
int main(){  
int a[10],n,i;    
system ("cls");  
printf("Enter the number to convert: ");    
scanf("%d",&n);    
for(i=0;n>0;i++)    
{    
a[i]=n%2;    
n=n/2;    
}    
printf("\nBinary of Given Number is=");    
for(i=i-1;i>=0;i--)    
{    
printf("%d",a[i]);    
}    
return 0;  
}


Output:
Enter the number to convert: 5
Binary of Given Number is=101
