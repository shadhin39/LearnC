If Statement
The if statement is used to check some given condition and perform some operations depending upon the correctness of that condition. It is mostly used in the scenario where we need to perform the different operations for the different conditions. The syntax of the if statement is given below.


if(expression){  
//code to be executed  
}  

 
Let's see a simple example of C language if statement.

#include<stdio.h>    
int main(){    
int number=0;    
printf("Enter a number:");    
scanf("%d",&number);    
if(number%2==0){    
printf("%d is even number",number);    
}    
return 0;  
}    


Output:

Enter a number:4
4 is even number
enter a number:5


Program to find the largest number of the three.

#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  
{  
    int a, b, c;   
     printf("Enter three numbers?");  
    scanf("%d %d %d",&a,&b,&c);  
    if(a>b && a>c)  
    {  
        printf("%d is largest",a);  
    }  
    if(b>a  && b > c)  
    {  
        printf("%d is largest",b);  
    }  
    if(c>a && c>b)  
    {  
        printf("%d is largest",c);  
    }  
    if(a == b && a == c)   
    {  
        printf("All are equal");   
    }  
}  


Output:
Enter three numbers?
12 23 34
34 is largest
