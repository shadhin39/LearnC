   Sum of digits program in C

C program to sum each digit: We can write the sum of digits program in c language by the help of loop and mathematical operation only.
Sum of digits algorithm
To get sum of each digits by c program, use the following algorithm:
Step 1: Get number by user
Step 2: Get the modulus/remainder of the number
Step 3: sum the remainder of the number
Step 4: Divide the number by 10
Step 5: Repeat the step 2 while number is greater than 0.
Let's see the sum of digits program in C.

#include<stdio.h>  
 int main()    
{    
int n,sum=0,m;    
printf("Enter a number:");    
scanf("%d",&n);    
while(n>0)    
{    
m=n%10;    
sum=sum+m;    
n=n/10;    
}    
printf("Sum is=%d",sum);    
return 0;  
}


Output:
Enter a number:654
Sum is=15
Enter a number:123
Sum is=6
